One thing that was troubling me here, was if I have to create the three new exit variables in the Place class or in the MultipleExitPlace class. I have included them in the later. However, in my drawing I have included them in the Place class objects, I have namely used the same drawing as in exercise 2 and added the list of exit Place objects. Retrospectively, I see that it might have been better to include them in the Place class. 

In this exercise I have assigned 8 places to mark the end of the game.
