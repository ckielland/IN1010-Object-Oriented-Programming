The game is set so that every player has a fortune which is the items their backpack contain. The players do
not have any cash - money, only items. They start the game with a backpack with 5 items (max capacity for all TreasureChest objects, i.e. both the players' backpacks and the board's chest is 10) and in each turn they are asked to buy and/or sell to the board, meaning that they can exchange items with the board and hope the one they will get from the board will be of higher value than the one they gave to the board. The game is over either when a player has reached the end (in Oppgave 2, 3 and 6 this is when the last place has been reached, in Oppgave 4 - 5 there have been some places marked as end places) or when the players have placed their last item to the board and don't wish to exchange it with anything from the board. (In this case, the fortune would be 0 and the player will lose, it is therefore an alternative way to exit voluntarily the game). The player cannot quit the game without selling their items, neither can they sell all items at the same time. They can put only one item to the board at a time, therefore if someone wishes to quit, he has to wait until he has placed all items to the board, one item at a time.

Once an item is sold to the market, its value changes with a max alteration of 10%. After the item is sold, its price is constantly updated to the price it was sold for last time.

In Exercise 6 I didn't have the time to implement the threads in the multiple terrain version of exercise 4, so I have implemented in the version of exercise 2.
